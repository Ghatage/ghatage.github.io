Hey there! I'm Anup Ghatage. I love to code and to do sleight of hand magic.
<br>I specialize (or so I would like to think) in systems programming.
<br>Other areas of interest include: 
<br> `distributed systems`, `high availability` and `database internals`
<br>I have also dabbled in `compiler internals` and `computer vision`
<br>Yes, I am all over the place.
<br>
<br>I'm a University of Pune grad with a Masters Degree in Computer Science.
<br>I worked at Sybase Inc. as a Kernel Engineer for Sybase's flagship database called 'Adaptive Server Enterprise'
<br>
<br>Currently I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Computer Science, Information Systems and Business.
